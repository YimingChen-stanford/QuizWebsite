# QuizWebsite
This is a course project I did with (Wei Wang and Biao Song);

I implemented the following features:
1. Randomly displaying of questions in different orders;
2. Displaying of questions in one page or multiple pages at user's choice;
3. For multiple pages user can select immediate feedback which offers feedback when finishing one question.(If not selected feedback will noly be available when finishing the whole quiz);
4. User can choose practice mode in which the system will not record the user's performance on the quiz. The computer provides additional assistance in practice mode by repeating questions that the user has difficulty with and removing questions that the user knows well;
5. User will get achivements after he has taken or created enough quizzes;
6. Compute user's score based on different modes and different question types;
7. A user can edit the quiz if he is the eidtor of that quiz;
